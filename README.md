## About the User 
- The ideal user for this application is someone wishing to create vocabulary cards to test their knowledge
- They have a list of terms that they should have memorized for future utilization 

## Features
- Firebase integration
- Navigation bar that allows a user to add vocabulary, sort vocabulary by All, sort vocabulary by Webpack, sort vocabulary by Javascript, sort vocabulary by HTML, sort vocabulary by CSS, that can all be searched using a search bar
- Vocabulary cards are able to be deleted, edited, and studied
- When a user clicks the study button a card appers with the vocab term with a hover function that flips the card to reveal the definition
